Bol達o is a traditional Guess Game where the users post their guesses and score points acoording to the matches results.
Groups of friends usually make a Bol達o during World Cups or Football leagues.

This Bol達o app is flexible and you can customize it to whatever sport or competition you want as long as 
it has Versus matches (like football, basketbal, volleyball and so on).

Each guess must be saved before the match start. When a match starts it's not possible to update or save a guess for
that match.

It also has a Ranking system that is updated on the end of each match generating scores for users who guess the final
result.
