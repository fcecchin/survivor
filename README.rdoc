Bol達o is a traditional Guess Game where the users post their guesses for matches and then score points acoording to the matches results.
Groups of friends usually make a Bol達o during World Cups or Football leagues.

This Bol達o app is flexible and you can customize it to whatever sport or competition you want as long as 
it has Versus matches (like football, basketbal, volleyball and so on).

Each guess must be saved before the match start. When a match starts it's not possible to update or save a guess for
that match.

It also has a Ranking system that is updated on the end of each match generating scores for users who guess the final
result.

== Configs

There is no special configs to do. You will just need to add a user admin (admin=true) to manage the bolao through
Rails Admin. 

Each match should belong to a Group (like in world cup: Group A, Group B, Final...) and it's better and easier 
to use seeds in order to fill your bolao matches (see an exemple at db/seeds.rb)

If you want to make it possible to sign in with facebook, then you will need to set the following environment variables:
- APP_BOLAO_FACEBOOK_ID
- APP_BOLAO_FACEBOOK_PASS

In this case I'm using UOL CDN to retrieve the team's images. You can customize it according to the tournament or league
your Bolao is running as well.

This app is I18n ready. Available translations: en, pt-BR
